# WHAT IS

"YAML Ain't Markup Language". Human-readable data-serialization language. Commonly used for config files and in apps where data is stored or transmitted. Targets similar apps as XML but has minimal syntax intentionally different from SGML. Uses both Python-style indentation nesting (but tab character not allowed) and more compact format that uses `[]` for lists and `{}` for maps, making YAML 1.2 superset of JSON.

Natively encodes scalars (string, integer, and float), list, and associative array (map or dictionary). Allows custom data type.

Recommended file extension `.yaml`.
